    "# AWS Sagemaker Image Classification of Dog Breed \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to do image classification with a pre-trained model in AWS Sagemaker.\n",
    "We use a pretrained convolutional neural network with 50 layers (resnet50) in Pytorch Vision. The CNN is improved by using residual learning that shortcuts connections by skipping layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is fine-tuned to our image data set, consisting of dog images labelled by breed. \n",
    "This is done using a hyper parameter job to train it in Sagemaker. \n",
    "Finally, we enable profiling and debugging with hooks to track the progress of our model training. Ultimately, we obtain a supervised image classifier that can tell the breed of dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging helps troubleshoot the training of our neural network (e.g., vanishing/exploding gradients, bad weight initialization, saturated activation, overfitting, class imbalance, loss).\n",
    "\n",
    "Profiling helps create a report while training that tracks the progress of our model training.\n",
    "Finally, profiling can help measure GPU, CPU, and memory utilization. "

    "## Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "We will finetune a pretrained model with hyperparameter tuning. \n",
    "We need to tune at minimum two hyperparameters.\n",
    "Optionally, we can explain why we pick those hyperparameters and ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do finetuning (i.e., transfer learning), we will add a fully connected neural network layer on top of the pretrained model as the output layer, which can perform classification of 133 breeds. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the Adam optimizer (with adaptive learning rate) from Pytorch and the following hyperparameters:\n",
    "- Learning rate: 0.000001 (10^-6) to 1.0 (10^0) \n",
    "- Epsilon: 1 to 3 \n",
    "- Weight decay: 0 to 0.1 (1e-1) \n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate controls the step size at which we move in the direction towards the minimum of a loss function during each training iteration. Epsilon controls the threshold at which we automatically discard redundant layers that produce responses smaller than this threshold: [epsilon-ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01661). Namely, epsilon controls the tradeoff between accuracy and network size and is typically in the 1-3 range. The weight decay is a regularizing term controlling the weights by penalizing/shrinking them during backprogation to avoid overfitting. It is usually set between 0 and 0.1: [ML Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-reduce-overfitting-in-deep-learning-with-weight-regularization/). \n",
